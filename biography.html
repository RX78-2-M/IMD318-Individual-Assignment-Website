            My name that has been given to me, is Muhammad Adib Irfan bin Ferus Syah. The name many call me is Adib.
I was born on 8 August 2005, at the current year of 2025 I am of the age of 20 years old. I was born in the city of Kuantan, located in Pahang, I am a citizen of Malaysia.
As a kid, I spent my first 5 years in Malaysia growing up with my family of 5. I was the second born son of the 3.
In 2010, me and my family went to the country of New Zealand in courtesy of my mother's PHD. Until the year 2014, I grew up in New Zealand
for 4 years, making new friends from all over the world and experiencing brand new environments of another country. I undergo both kindergarten and the primary school
of Lincoln Primary School in New Zealand. After 2014, me and my family have finally returned to Malaysia, in where we settled in Kuantan in the state of Pahang. I would then
enter 3rd grade primary school in "Sekolah Kebangsaan Indera Mahkota Utama" until 6th grade. After my primary school years I would enter highschool in the school of
"Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Alor Akar", "MRSM Kubang Pasu" and "MRSM Tun Abdul Razak" for the first form. In the year of 2019 in which I enter second form of
highschool, my family has moved from Kuantan to Kajang in Selangor. I have entered the highschool of "Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Jalan Empat" in which I have
studied from the second form until form five in which I take the big exam of SPM. Afterwards I would then enter University studying the Diploma of Information Management
